`mapping` provides functionality for mapping to and from generic exposures and
tradeable instruments for financial assets.

An example of this might be on 2016-12-01 we would have `CL1 -> CLZ16`, i.e.
the first generic for Crude oil on the above date corresponds to trading the
December 2016 contract.

The main features of `mapping` include:

- creating continuous return series for Futures instruments
- creating time series of percentage allocations to tradeable contracts
- creating instrument trade lists
